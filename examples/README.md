# Examples (Non-Normative)

This directory contains **non-normative** examples.

The goal is to demonstrate how a project can implement the **Control Plane** that executes the contract tasks, while keeping the **contract itself tool-agnostic**.

- These examples are not required for compliance.
- These examples may reference specific tools.
- Provider adapters should remain thin and contain no business logic.

See the normative contract in `contracts/v1/CONTRACT-open-cicd-contract.md`.
